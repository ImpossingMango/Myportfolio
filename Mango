EXPERIENCE JABATAN PENDIDIKAN KOMPUTER NEGERI(JPKN)
Industrial Trainee ( August 2022 - October 2022 )
I was assigned to the Software and IT department. I focused onthe software 
application improvement and IoT development. I was tasked with optimizing the 
face recognition software and migrating it to the cloud, making it a more accurate 
and user-friendly online attendance system for the department. Additionally, I
assisted in developing IoT system to be used as a guide and introduction for 
people in rural areas. I also participated in modifying the department computer for 
improvement in term of softwares.

SECTION SKILLS
FACE RECOGNITION ATTENDANCE SYSTEM
Face recognition is a way of identifying or confirming an individual’s identity using their face. Face recognition 
is defined as a biometric method in which identification of an individual is performed by comparing real-time 
capture image with stored images in the database of that person
SHARP IR SENSOR DISTANCE MEASUREMENT
An infrared sensor is an electrical device that detects specific aspects of its environment. It accomplishes this 
using emitted or detected infrared light. Infrared sensors can also detect motion and measure how much heat 
an item emits
PATIENT HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM
The patient health record system enables patients to access their records with the help of admin. 
Patients can store and update their information in the system. They can book appointments through 
available slots. Admins manage users, including editing, deleting, and searching their information. Admin 
review health records, prescriptions, and issues. Admins can also add new administrators.
 ELEVATOR CONTROL SYSTEM
This project is to control the elevator with the help of intel 8085 microprocessor. We use the four-floor elevator 
models to show the microprocessor controlling the elevator
FINAL YEAR PROJECT ON ANALYSIS OF IOT BASED SLOPE HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM
Researching the analysis of health slopes and landslides using IoT involves using smart technology to monitor 
and reduce geological risks. By using sensors and data systems, researchers aim to track slopes and landslideprone areas in real time. This research also studies different types of soils to understand their stability and risk 
of landslides. Soil composition and moisture levels affect how stable the ground is. Studying these factors helps 
us prevent and manage landslides better, additionally improving our knowledge of geological risks and make 
smarter decisions in urban planning and disaster management.
